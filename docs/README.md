  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - [How to install](#how-to-install)
  - [Thanks](#thanks)

## Prerequisites

In order to have this working, it is advised that you already have a webserver running and correctly configured.
You will also need to install [live_map](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map) on your FiveM server and have it configured.

## How to install

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map-interface/archive/master.zip).

This should be enough to get the interface up and running on your website. If you want to change stuff like the images, look in the [configuration](https://github.com/DaveOkpare/live_map-interface/blob/DaveOkpare-patch-1/docs/config.md) section


## Thanks

Special thanks to the people who helped me test this, flushing out any bugs that managed to sneak in.
